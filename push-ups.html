<p>
Get into a high plank position. Place your hand firlmy on the gorund, directly under shoulders. Ground your toes intothe floor to stabilize your lower half.
Lower your body. Begin to lower your body,  keeping your back flat and eyes focused about three feet in front of you to keep a natural neck - until your chest grazes the floor. Don't let your butt dip or stick out at any point.
Push back up. Exhale as you push back to the starting position.
