 <p>
  Jumping jacks are a fun way to exercise your body.
 You can do jumping jacks by jumping and spreading your legs apart
 while putting your arms together above your head at the same time.
 You jump again and put your legs and arms back together/apart,
 and you have done one jumping jack!

 Jumping Jacks can be pretty hard, but they make your legs stronger!
