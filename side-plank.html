    <p>
      Make, like, a triangle shape: lie on your side with your right elbow
      on the ground, and stack your left foot on top of your right foot.
      Now lift your butt off the ground so only you right arm and right foot
      are touching the ground.  Make your whole body straight.

    <p>
      The purpose of this exercise is to strengthen your core.
